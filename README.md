# Service Collection Extension Example

This is a project that goes along with my blog post at https://treycook.dev/blog/extension.

It's a .NET Core 3.1 web API project based off the boilerplate provided from the command "dotnet new webapi". A dummy humidity service was added as an example of how to add a service and an extension method for it on top of the .NET DI service collection class.
